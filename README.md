# Minimal Image Resizer

Resize images in batches using nothing but a browser and Vanilla JS. This project was born out of the need to conform large quantities of photos to a given dimension on a corporate computer with no adequate software installed. Keep in mind that [Minimal Image Resizer is quick solution to make the pain go away, **not a showcase of how to do such a thing properly**](https://xkcd.com/1926).

## Usage

Open `src/index.html` in any moderately recent browser of your fancy, select your images with the file browser and then save the resulting output images. You can also use the [deployed version](https://janhett.github.io/minimal-image-resizer/).
